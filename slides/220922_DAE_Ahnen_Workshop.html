						<h1>Workshop Premise</h1>
						<p>Dig into your own relationship to a possible "ancestral" cosmology</p>
						<p>Reflect on how this cosmology intersects with your being a body with a voice</p>
						<p>              ...and your becoming a "voice without a body"</p>
						<p>Speculate on the possibility of a generative "AI" system as ancestral media, encoding traces of your embodied life</p>
						<p>                   ...your knowledges(?), values(?), traditions(?)</p>
						<p>Create an audio snapshot of your voice</p>
						<p>Create a small audio/radio work playing with these ideas using recordings of biological and artificial voices</p>
					</section>

					<section>
						<h1>RECEPTION</h1>
						<p>What has been passed down to you? -> Through what actions / efforts?</p>
						<p>Or... flip this, who do you consider your ancestors? What have you inherited from them?</p>
						<p>What time scales are you thinking in? Years? Generations? Millennia?</p>
						<p>Through what media have you received this inheritance? How was it transmitted to you? By writing? By genetics? Through speaking to, or working with, others? Online? Via institutions?</p>
					</section>

					<section>
						<h1>TRANSMISSION</h1>
						<p>You are also an ancestor, at this very moment your life is part of lineages and futures.</p>
						<p>How have you received your inheritances and heritages? What do you transmit and produce?</p>
						<p>Have you rejected? Accepted? Transformed? Repeated?</p>
					</section>

					<section>
						<h1>ANNOTATIONS</h1>
						<p>If you were going to put this content into a database, what would you want to accompany it?</p>
						<p>How do you want your voice to be received? - metadata, notes, credits, instructions, recipes etc</p>
						<p>think of yourself as an ancestor passing down an heirloom, or old photographs. Is there anything you would want to be known about them?</p>

						<h1>A Few Perspectives...</h1>
						<div class="hl1">
					<quote>"Will future generations speak of the wisdom of their ancestors as
						we are inclined to speak of ours? It is relevant and even part of
						wisdom to ask not only are we being good citizens of the world today,
						but are we being good ancestors." (Salk, 1977)</quote>

						<quote>"There is a saying in the West that we cannot choose our
							parents but we can choose our ancestors. This means that each
							generation can choose from the past the models left by those
							who have preceded. It means choosing from the past that
							which is homologous to what has to be done at this point in time" (Salk, 1977)

					<h1>1-minute Voice Snapshot</h1>
						<ol>
						<li>Take 10 minutes to think about making a voice recording that is a snapshot of you in this moment, as an ancestor.</li>
						<p>Start with one of the prompts.</p>

						<p>What are you going to say? And how will you say it?</p>

						<li>Use an audio recorder or connect to an audio interface and record your snapshot as a wav file</li>

						<li>When done - copy the recording to your laptop, and write any anotations in a text file together with your audio recording. Name them the same! ( YourName_voiceprint.wav  YourName_voiceprint.txt )</li>
						</ol>
				</section>

				<section>

					<h1>Recording Tips</h1>

					<p>Check the recording format - make sure you're recording as a 48khz/16-bit wav! (DVD quality audio)</p>

					<p>Check your levels before you record! You want your voice to be around -12 to -6 dB on average. If necessary reduce the gain/volume on your input.</p>

					<p>Speak "off axis" to the microphone in order to avoid plosives</p>

				</section>

				<section>
					<h1>Prompts</h1>

					<p>Is there a piece of information you have learned, or have generated, that you wish to exist beyond yourself?</p>
					<p>Will you be an echo? A repeater? Is there a voice (online, for example) that you wish to amplify?</p>
					<p>Traditions can exist through repetition, repeating, copying, and modifying - but only continue if they are transmitted and received</p>
					<p>What time scales are you interested in? Years? Generations?</p>
					<p>Your voice is connected to you as a body, at a certain age, a moment of health. What can your voice transmit outside and around your words?</p>
					<p>What has been passed down to you from your ancestors? Through which media? Through what action was it transmitted to you?<p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Annotating</h2>
						<p>If you were going to put this content into a database, what would you want to accompany it?</p>
						<p>How do you want your voice to be received? - metadata, notes, credits, instructions, recipes etc</p>
						<p>think of yourself as an ancestor passing down an heirloom, or old photographs. Is there anything you would want to be known about them?</p>

						<h1>Making an Artificial Voice</h1>
						<ol>
							<li>Preparing a Voice Print</li>
							<p>You should have Audacity installed! (( <a href="https://www.audacityteam.org/">audacityteam.org</a> )) </p>
							<li>Using the Voice Cloning Toolkit</li>
							<p>(( copy the colab notebook into your own Google drive space ))</p>
							<li>Composing in Audacity (if time allows)</li>
						</ol>
					</section>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h1>1. Preparing your Voice for the Algorithms</h1>

					<ul>
						<li>Import your voice recording into Audacity</li>
						<li>Mixdown to mono if needed: Tracks -> Mix -> Mix Stereo Down to Mono</li>
						<li>Normalize to 0db so that we have a reference point for listening</li>
						<li>Critical listening: pay attention to details, noise levels, artefacts</li>
						<li>Noise Reduction</li>
						<li>Noise Gating (if desired for extreme audio clarity / reduced ambience)</li>
						<li>Compression (if desired to make the voice more "present" or "even")</li>
						<li>Other cleanups (cut out silence & noises)</li>
						<li>Finally: Export as a 48khz/16-bit monophonic wav, include any metadata annotations you like!</li>
					</ul>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h1>2. Using the Voice Cloning Toolkit</h1>
					<ul>
					<li>Open the voice cloning colab notebook (( <a href="http://shorturl.at/gimSY">shorturl.at/gimSY</a> ))</li>
					<li>Make a copy and save to your own Google Drive space: File > Make a copy</li>
					<li>(1) Connect to a runtime  (2) install dependencies  (3) import modules</li>
					<li>Run the cell to upload your voice print</li>
					<li>Run the cell to synthesize artificial speech (choose a language, type some text)
					<li>Download your synthesized speech wav files by right-clicking on the audio player widget and choosing "save file as"</li>
					</ul>

				<section>
					<h1>3. Composing in Audacity</h1>
					<p>If time allows before 15:00! A quick note on composing multi-track audio in Audacity</p>

					<quote>
						Our story cuts across multiple layers of time but we were never granted with the
authority of a historical actor by the archive. Our voices were excluded, lost, forgotten,
and we exist only as, what Saidiya Hartman calls, a ‘critical fabulation’, the ‘double
gesture’ of writing ‘a cultural history of the captive’, and, at the same time, ‘enacting
the impossibility of representing them’ through the process of narration.

					<quote>“The intent of this practice is not to give voice ..., but rather to imagine what cannot be verified, a
					realm of experience which is situated between two zones of death—social and
					corporeal —and to reckon with the precarious lives which are visible only in the moment of their disappearance.”</quote>

				<section>
					<h1>Free Work Time</h1>

					<p>Work on refining your voice snapshot - or thinking about what you would like to say / how to say it</p>

					<p>Compose a more open-ended audio artefact within the "ancestral" cosmology that you are building, you can think of this as a short radio broadcast</p>

					<p>Experiment with combining artificial + biological voice recordings as an ancestral object</p>

					<p>Does your ancestral broadcast contain more than one voice? Harmonize with others, "borrow" their voices. </p>

					<p>Reflect on what annotations you would include with your audio fragments</p>

					<p>
						Last week, you told each other a story and recounted in the first person. Now you can make someone say something that they have never said.
