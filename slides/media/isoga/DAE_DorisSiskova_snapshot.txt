Snapshot:


Zlaté vrabce z toho tŕnia
Perlami sa hrdo kŕmia
Diamantové sa plodia psy
A bez románov do kapsy
 
S hlavou čistou ako raj
Nie Slovák som, lež samuraj
Príbehy sa rodia rýchlo
Zas myšlienkami sa ti kýchlo
 
Žiaden mudrc, asi klaun
Priznávam sa celkom down
 
Lebo som down
LSDown
Lebo som down
LSDown
 
Translation: 


The golden sparrows get goosebumps
They proudly feed on pearls
Diamond dogs are born
And without pocket novels
 
With a head as clear as paradise
No, I'm Slovak, I'm a samurai
Stories are born quickly
Your thoughts made you sneeze again
 
No sage, probably a clown
I admit I'm quite down
 
Because I'm down
LSDown
Because I'm down
LSDown



This song is a lyrical masterpiece by one of the most influential composers in Slovakia. By recording my singing, I want to look back at the ways my father used to interpret this song about drug use to me and my sister when we were young. I want to archive my current experience of living in a liberal country and I want all the generations after me to remember how sublime the Slovak language could be.
