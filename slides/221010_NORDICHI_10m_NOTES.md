# In Search of Good Ancestors
addressing the challenge of creating a long-form audio artwork, a year-long generative radio broadcast.

Considering voice. Text. What is said. And what is amplified. How to reflect on the authority of a dataset.

Jonas Salk's 1977 address "Are we being good ancestors?", one of the major proponents of an ancestral ethics in Anglo-American modernity.

Here, Salk, a reknown altruist, calls for the cultures of "the West" to make intergenerational responsibility the highest moral imperative [3]. Through the year the BroadCaster repeatedly attempts to extrapolate on this lecture, its predictions altered by the contributions of texts, stylistic annotations and voice recordings collected in the workshops. Thus, new vocal identities, dialogic structures and thematics emerge, while those of the initial and previous trainings decay over time. The work proposes a methodology that embraces the inherent instability of the statistical model as a memory and its tendencies to catastrophically forget when trained on data whose diversity unfolds over time.


# Prediction, Perpetuation and Uncertainty

The system perpetually attempts to derive new next from this starting prompt. Initially it does so using pre-trained speech and text models.

(NOTE: which ones? name models and their datasets for Q&A)

# Intervention and Data Stewardship

(what is it called when you care for land? stewardship?)
However, this is an old and dead text, and a dataset is dead as soon as it has been created.

While the algorithms attempt to predict what "should come next" (highlighting their predictive nature) - it is in the nature of these predictions, and other aesthetic interventions that the investigation of voicing, speech, and text is developed. e.g. the perception of algorithmically generated text, the juxtaposition of text that is warped, malformed, and transformed into other domains (non-human, choral, multi-human) that attempts to interject pluralities within the standardized "public dataset".


# The Artificial BroadCaster


# Developing a Year-long Dramaturgy based in Process

The work's core has to do with process.
The work develops organically into a sonic collage of mixed artificial and biological voice material.

Thereby the process of learning, as the primary dramaturgy of the work. Developed through a series of workshops investigating different aspects of the system (LLM text generation, voice synthesis) and experimenting with ways of acting upon the training process.

It within these predictions that the investigation of voicing, speech, and writing is developed through fine-tuning and annotation, seeking to build "plurality" into the initially standardized benchmark datasets.

Further, the synthesized voice is transformed into other domains (non-human, choral, multi-human) via multiple Realtime Audio Variational Autoencoder (RAVE) models that attempts to aesthetically interject a second layer, one that emphasizes perceptual uncertainty in the listener.

The dramaturgy of the project evolves through the process of collaborative data interventions in the form of workshops

The workshop interventions are a further step in creating a plurality of "voices", or intentions within the strata of the data and model.

The workshops serve as a way to collectively construct artistic datasets while also serving as points of knowledge exchange for open, ML technologies.

# Workshop 1

working with generative text, introducing new text material to the "dataset" for "fine tuning", using "context" to steer the text generation into different directions, themes, and ways of writing
reading / writing together - performing text

Intervening on text. Collecting text. Developing annotations and "magic words" - in collaboration with Varia.



# Workshop 2
Intervening with voice. Exploring the experience of encountering one's voice identity disembodied and under the control of another. Investigations of data provenance and futurity of one's voice within an "ancestral" cosmology that emphasizes lineages of data and their comingling within the "memory" of a ML model.

writing "wishes for future use" of the voice recordings

performing synthetic voices as a chorus, reading together as a performance, reading/performing together with artificial voice clones

In Search of Good Ancestors / Ahnen in Arbeit is a year-long
generative radio artwork investigating the concept of machine
learning algorithms as instable memory. A 24-hour broadcast on
German Public Radio features the voice(s) of an artificial Broad-
Caster, a bespoke instrument utilizing deep learning text and speech
models that begin pre-trained on ubiquitous public research datasets
[1] [2]. The BroadCaster evolves via trainings on small-scale datasets
created collaboratively in a series of public workshops. Each work-
shop is unique, run in various European locations or online, and
reflects the subjectivities of each group of participants. They serve
as a framework for developing practice-based approaches to ac-
tivities such as curating training texts, designing annotations for
expressive text generation, performing with voice clones or record-
ing voice data in both individual and collective scenarios. Following
a workshop, the collected data is reviewed and used to fine-tune
the BroadCaster’s models and inspire aesthetic inventions in the
compositions and vocal identities within the broadcast.

The work-plus-workshops navigates themes of long-term and
intergenerational thinking - using as its seminal text American
virologist Jonas Salk’s 1977 lecture "Are we being good ancestors?".
Here, Salk, a reknown altruist, calls for the cultures of "the West"
to make intergenerational responsibility the highest moral impera-
tive [3]. Through the year the BroadCaster repeatedly attempts to
extrapolate on this lecture, its predictions altered by the contribu-
tions of texts, stylistic annotations and voice recordings collected in
the workshops. Thus, new vocal identities, dialogic structures and
thematics emerge, while those of the initial and previous trainings
decay over time. The work proposes a methodology that embraces
the inherent instability of the statistical model as a memory and its
tendencies to catastrophically forget when trained on data whose
diversity unfolds over time.

The value of public workshops as artistic method relies on the diverse backgrounds of the participants, who are not experts in machine learning. Their willingness or resistance to contribute speech recordings to the broadcast, the joys and frustrations of those from different language backgrounds yield a form of tacit exploration and appropriation of open source text and speech technologies. This approach allows a plurality of intentions and (literal) voices to become part of the work in a way that resonates with its thematics.

This project is ongoing and the methods of the project are in
continual development. Each workshop informs the next with new
insights into the poetics and politics of data collection and model
training. The broadcast streams from January 2022 - February 2023
at ahnen.in, while fragments are played intermittently on German
Public Radio. The workshops’ activities were conceived in collabora-
tion with artist-researcher Eleni Ikoniadou, and Joana Chicau, amy
pickles and Cristina Cochior of VARIA. This work is supported by
CTM Festival, Deutschlandfunk Kultur and the Leverhulme Trust.
