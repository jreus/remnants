				(SLIDE - Wordless)
				previous work: Morton Feldman piece, interesting to create a voice from an individual who refused to be recorded... how would such a person be remembered in a data-driven human history?
					(PLAY SNIPPET - Wordless audio)

					Beckett mute interview for Swedish television: https://lithub.com/samuel-becketts-insane-wordless-post-nobel-prize-interview-is-the-most-samuel-beckett-thing-ever/
					Beckett speaks: https://www.openculture.com/2010/04/samuel_beckett_speaks.html

					If Beckett seems to mispronounce certain consonant sounds, it may have something to do with a surgery he had in November of 1964 to remove a tumor in his jaw. The surgery temporarily left Beckett with a hole in the roof of his mouth. According to a 1998 article by Peter Swaab in The Times Literary Supplement, the recordings were probably made in March of 1965, when Beckett was awaiting a follow-up surgery to fix his palate. Still, many listeners have been struck by the beauty of the recordings. As Swaab writes:

					Beckett’s voice is unexpectedly soft, and seems more suited to the serenely commiserative vein of his writing than the splenetic and cynical one. He reads the poems a lot more slowly than the prose–with a pronounced chanting mellifluousness…. The overall effect of these rare and fascinating recordings is of a delivery like that which Beckett recommended to the actor David Warrilow for Ohio Impromptu, “calm, steady, designed to soothe”–or (to bring in two of the central words in Watt) a “murmur” meant to “assuage.” The tape evidently records a sort of rehearsal, and the perfectionist Beckett would surely not have been satisfied with it, but it is good to know that his voice has not altogether disappeared.

					Despite his fascination with memory technologies (as evidenced in Krapp’s Last Tape) and vocation as a writer, Samuel Beckett was notorious for avoiding at all costs the recording of his voice, words and image on to recording media, as he said to his first biographer Deirdre Bair, that he “did not give interviews”, that he “never allowed pencil and paper,” and that “the question of the tape recorder is one which must never come up”1. Morton Feldman, on the other hand, pursued a kind of indeterminacy and unclassifiability in his music—an “insistence on not forming images” as German philosopher Dieter Mersch once put it

					https://ask.metafilter.com/36312/Are-there-any-extant-recordings-of-Samuel-Becketts-voice

					https://www.poetryfoundation.org/harriet-books/2013/03/a-rare-recording-of-beckett-reading-from-watt

					Samuel Beckett was notoriously shy around recording devices.
					He would spend hours in a studio working with actors, but when it came to recording a piece in his own voice he was elusive.
					Only a handful of recordings are known to exist. So the audio above of Beckett reading a pair of his poems is extremely rare.

					(SLIDE - Prompt: A year-long, generative radio broadcast)
					ISOGA: is a confluence of these thoughts within the challenge of creating a long-form audio artwork, a year-long generative radio broadcast.
					Considering voice. Text. What is said. And what is amplified. How to reflect on authority, and also reflect upon an important cosmological perspective: how can I, or you, think of yourself as a future ancestor. This is an open question that is ongoing within the arc of the project.

				<!--
				(SLIDE - A starting point)
				Jonas Salk's 1977 address "Are we being good ancestors?", one of the major proponents of an ancestral ethics in Anglo-American modernity. The system perpetually attempts to derive new next from this starting prompt.

				Here, Salk, a reknown altruist, calls for the cultures of "the West"
				to make intergenerational responsibility the highest moral impera-
				tive [3]. Through the year the BroadCaster repeatedly attempts to
				extrapolate on this lecture, its predictions altered by the contribu-
				tions of texts, stylistic annotations and voice recordings collected in
				the workshops. Thus, new vocal identities, dialogic structures and
				thematics emerge, while those of the initial and previous trainings
				decay over time. The work proposes a methodology that embraces
				the inherent instability of the statistical model as a memory and its
				tendencies to catastrophically forget when trained on data whose
				diversity unfolds over time.

						<p class="hl1">If passed, this bill will punish being LGBTQIA+ with imprisonment. Anyone renting property or providing web hosting to LGBTQIA+ initiatives will also be at risk of being sent to prison.</p>

						<h1 class="hl2">Become a Donor</h1>
						<p class="hl1">We are seeking donors to support the purchase of a permanent space that cannot be threatened with eviction.</p>
						<p class="hl1">This will ensure the continued operation of the residency program, international exchange, and create a resiliant space for radical art practices in Kumasi. A space that is welcome to queer and non-queer people.</p>
