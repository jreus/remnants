## 12:00 - 12:30 - Introductions/ Discussing Data Ownership & Consent

### Introduce ourselves

### Introduce the general project

### Concept 

In this workshop we will explore ancestral cosmology through the figure of the clone in artificial voice technologies. The workshop will experiment with dialogues between the future and the past using voice avatars of ourselves and other participants, considering the implications of creating a clone that may speak to generations beyond our own lifetime. 

Data. Memory. Prediction. What traces of our living selves remain within machine learnings? What aspects of identity would we want to preserve, or do we choose to allow our clones to take on a completely different identity? How do we encode wishes and messages that exceed both our temporary bodies and recorded data? How do we populate a data+algorithmic memory space with remnants that carry possible messages - to be ancestors, as opposed to ghosts?


You are asked to consider your own relationship to an open-ended conception of ancestry, relating to the ideas and actions of those having lived and those yet to be. The artistic contributions will be part of a process of collaboratively building datasets which are used to train the machine learning models of the artificial BroadCaster in the year-long radio broadcast >>In Search of Good Ancestors / Ahnen in Arbeit<< ( ahnen.in ) whose voices are shaped by learning the nuances of human and non-human recorded utterances. 

### More in depth

The example of Common Voice https://commonvoice.mozilla.org
 
The aim is to train a speech recognition tool with voice and text samples that have been given with consent. What happenes to this database of voices that is completely public?

You give your voice according to Creative Commons license, you maybe understand, maybe not, by participating, that your recordings become part of this project. 

You feed with your voice the BroadCaster

### Your wish

What if we can send a wish for our voice sample together with our consent for giving it away? We will create wishes that will be respected. After the workshop we implement these voices on the broadcast and follow these wishes. Imagine that this will last for a long time. Leave some data remaining. Fragments of it. Encourage people how their data is used instead of deleting. Fb delete the links of your data but not your data. The accessibility of the data is cut off. 

<!--future idea:
How to embed the wishes like they never disappear? Encode the wishes as audio inside, like a watermark. Transmitting audio only in frequency that are not audible.-->


### Split in groups of 5

## 12:30 - 14:00 - Introduction to ideas & first exercise 

### Contribution to the dataset: http://192.168.1.115:3000/

Introducing the tool +
Creating a Voice Heirloom: participants spend time reflecting on creating a ~1 minute voice recording, encapsulating some kind of message or expression that would become part of a dataset which outlasts their own lives. How do they care for this data entry? What instructions or wishes do they send along with it?

Outcomes:
* voice recording
* a text file with annotations and wishes for use
* participants will be asked to upload their voice recordings & annotations to a shared local webserver


Writing Exercise - Prompt (close eyes, listen to questions? check slides, write down what stays with you) - Come out with what you want to say 

Recording Basics - introduce recording stations + how to record

Editing the sound in audacity - normalize whole file, noise reduction, super clean: noise gate only voice parts, trim silence or noises, a little bit of compression

Think of and write your wish for your voice contribution ?

## 15:00 - 17:00 - Introduction to ideas & second exercise

### imaginary dialogue, performing another self, http://192.168.1.115:5000/

Introducing the tool +
Creating an Imaginary Intergenerational Dialogue: participants spend time imagining the figure of an ancestor or a life yet to be born, and create a dialogue between themself and this ancestral figure who shares, in some way, a lineage (biological, cultural, ideological) with the participant. The participant will write a short script and create this dialogue (possibly live?) using artificial voices, either their own or borrowed from others (and respecting their wishes). 

Outcomes:
* possibly a recording, or a live performance? can we / should we record live performances?


Borrowing other participants synthesized voices to read your (personal) text. Your words through another voice
